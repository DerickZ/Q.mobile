The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string ring's characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character key[i].\n\nIf the character key[i] has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\nInput: ring = \"godding\", key = \"gd\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character.  For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring \"godding\" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become \"ddinggo\". Also, we need 1 more step for spelling. So the final output is 4.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nLength of both ring and key will be in range 1 to 100.\nThere are only lowercase letters in both strings and might be some duplcate characters in both strings.\nIt's guaranteed that string key could always be spelled by rotating the string ring.\n\n","id":514,"key":"freedom-trail","level":3,"locked":false,"submits":18949,"title":"Freedom Trail"},{"accepts":33192,"data":"You need to find the largest value in each row of a binary tree.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: \n\n          1\n         / \\\n        3   2\n       / \\   \\  \n      5   3   9 \n\nOutput: [1, 3, 9]\n\n\n","id":515,"key":"find-largest-value-in-each-tree-row","level":2,"locked":false,"submits":59983,"title":"Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row"},{"accepts":25830,"data":"\nGiven a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

(Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.)  To be clear, the string /*/ does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string // occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string /* occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.
